    <p class="message">The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) played an important role in many of these processes – by providing key science and solutions on the triple planetary crisis, convening and supporting important negotiations, hosting critical multilateral environmental agreements, working with the private and financial sectors to align funding with global processes and supporting Member States to deliver on their commitments.</p>
    <p class="message">Progress is being made. The great task ahead is to accelerate this progress so that it moves faster than the intensification of the triple planetary crisis. As the leading global authority on the environment, UNEP will work tirelessly to help make this happen – through deploying digital technologies to provide forward-looking and relevant science, boosting the implementation of the multilateral environmental agreements that make change possible, and backing Member States to promote climate stability, live in harmony with nature and forge a pollution-free future. This is how we will deliver on the 2030 Agenda and create the conditions for a more peaceful and prosperous world.</p>

            <p class="topic">Measuring the Depth of the Climate Crisis</p>

        </div>
        <p class="climate">UNEP analysis released ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP28) brought into sharp focus the scale of the climate crisis and offered policymakers a suite of solutions.<br>

            The Emission Gap Report 2023: Broken Record – Temperatures hit new highs, yet world fails to cut emissions (again) showed that current climate pledges put the Earth on track to warm by 2.5-2.9°C this century, well above the goals of the Paris Agreement. <br><br>To keep warming below 1.5°C, greenhouse gas emissions must fall by 42 per cent by 2030. The Production Gap Report: Phasing down or phasing up? Top fossil fuel producers plan even more extraction despite climate promises found that governments’ plans to produce fossil fuels would obliterate the carbon budget for 1.5°C.
            
            Meanwhile, the Adaptation Gap Report: Underfinanced, Underprepared – Inadequate investment and planning on climate adaptation leaves world exposed, found that the adaptation finance gap was 50 per cent larger than previously thought. Developing countries need between US$215 billion to US$387 billion a year to withstand growing climate impacts.
            
            The UNEP analyses were mentioned by heads of state and negotiators during COP28, while the Adaptation Gap Report was cited in the Global Stocktake, the final COP28 decision that called on countries to transition away from fossil fuels. Over 3,300 articles on these “gap” analyses were published in 75-plus countries.</p>

            <h2>NATURE ACTION</h2>
            <p class="topic">Sustainably Managing the Natural World</p>

        </div>
        <p class="climate">With support from the GEF, UNEP is leading 24 projects in 21 countries, from Chile to Sri Lanka, to protect and revive a range of landscapes and seascapes. In 2023, that work supported the sustainable management of more than 560,000 hectares of ecosystems, an area roughly the size of Trinidad and Tobago. It also led to the creation of 254,000 hectares of protected areas and the conservation or restoration of 110,000 hectares of forests.

            Through the UN-REDD Programme, UNEP helped 17 countries to conserve and restore forests, which are crucial carbon sinks. The programme helped countries become eligible for a combined US$1.5 billion in results-based financing for forest conservation. Those efforts are also expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 100 million tonnes between now and 2026.
            
            The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, led by UNEP and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), showcased 10 pioneering restoration efforts. These Restoration Flagships were featured in 1,500 media stories and generated 70 million views on social media. The flagships aim to restore by 2030 more than 60 million hectares of land and sea as part of a commitment by countries to restore 1 billion hectares, an area larger than China, by 2030.
            
            UNEP advised Brazil on legislation, signed into law by President Luis Inácio Lula da Silva, to promote sustainable urban and peri-urban agriculture. The measure is expected to make healthy food more accessible and preserve biodiversity. It was part of a seven-country project, which ended in 2023, to reduce the environmental impact of food production.</p>

            <h2>POLLUTION ACTION</h2>
            <p class="topic">Reining in Chemical Pollution and Improving Human Health</p>

        </div>
        <p class="climate">In September, the world agreed on the Global Framework on Chemicals, a historic deal to protect people and the environment from chemical pollution, which causes an estimated 2 million deaths every year. The agreement has 28 targets, including a call for action on highly hazardous pesticides and a crackdown on illegal chemicals. UNEP will manage a dedicated trust fund in support of the framework. Germany has committed 20 million euros to the fund, with France, Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland also contributing.

            In early 2023, UNEP released the report Bracing for Superbugs. The report’s in-depth look at how environmental degradation is feeding the rise of antimicrobial resistance was covered by media in 70 countries. “We must remain focused on turning the tide in this crisis by raising awareness and by placing this matter of global importance on the agenda of the world’s nations,” said Barbados Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley, who launched the report alongside UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen.</p>
